<h1 align="center">UFO Sighting Analysis</h1>

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to visualize the UFO sighting data by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results of UFO Sighting Data Visualization

The UFO Sighting webpage was designed to visualize and to filter through the UFO sighting data with multiple criteria. Upon opening the webpage, the end user is presented with the complete dataset on the lower right portion of the page to give him/her a concept what data are available.

Based on the data presented, one could use any of the filters, or any combination of them, on the lower right corner, to filter out data that meet their chosen criteria.

As an example, the screenshot below shows the filtered result when the end user chooses any shape of sighting in La Mesa, CA on 1/1/2010.

## Summary
While the website is intuitive to use and fully functional, there are some drawbacks. The most noticeable one is that each time the end user deletes or changes a criteria, s/he must manually refresh the page to reload the original data to get ready for the next round of filtering.

To enhance user experience, I'd like to make two more suggestions to improve upon the functionality of this webpage.

1. The above-mentioned reloading issue could be better performed automatically for the page to fresh itself whenever a change is made in the filters.
2. The filters should have a dropdown box to show what choices are available. This way, the end user doesn't need to just choose from the shown data, or guess a city (and get it wrong).
